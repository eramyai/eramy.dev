  <h1>Eramy Wellness AI – Project Overview</h1>

  <p>Eramy Wellness AI is a personal wellness companion platform designed to integrate compassionate AI assistance with optional physician oversight. This document provides an overview of the project’s goals, features, and development roadmap.</p>

  <h2>Goals</h2>
  <p>The primary goal of Eramy Wellness AI is to provide empathetic, AI-driven support for individuals managing chronic illnesses, lifestyle changes, or emotional challenges. By bridging the gap between physician visits, the platform aims to improve adherence to medical advice and reduce feelings of isolation.</p>

  <h2>Key Features</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>AI-driven companion with a focus on empathy and emotional safety.</li>
    <li>Customizable features for mental health support, fitness tracking, and dietary guidance.</li>
    <li>Optional physician-configurable settings for tailored patient care.</li>
    <li>Secure and private data handling to ensure user trust.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Development Roadmap</h2>
  <p>The project is currently in the prototyping phase, with a focus on developing the core AI companion and physician configuration tools. Future milestones include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Beta testing with a small group of users.</li>
    <li>Integration of advanced AI features for personalized support.</li>
    <li>Launch of a subscription-based model with multiple tiers.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Commitment to Accessibility</h2>
  <p>While the platform will not offer a completely free tier due to the cost of AI usage, we are committed to keeping pricing reasonable and accessible to as many users as possible.</p>

  <p class="note">This project is independently developed and currently part-time. Full-time development is expected to begin in 2026 following retirement from professional commitments.</p>
